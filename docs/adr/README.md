# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture decisions for the Bonobo Engine are recorded here as ADRs, one file per decision.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-{number}: {Title}

**Date:** {date}
**Status:** Accepted | Superseded by ADR-{n} | Deprecated

## Context
{What prompted this decision? What are the constraints?}

## Options Considered
1. **{Option A}** — {description}
2. **{Option B}** — {description}

## Decision
{Which option was chosen and why.}

## Consequences
- {What changes as a result}
- {What trade-offs were accepted}
```

## Process

- Create an ADR whenever an architecturally significant decision is made (architecture, library, approach).
- Number sequentially (`ADR-001`, `ADR-002`, …).
- Recommended entry points: `docs/game-development/session/session-prompt.md` (Decision Protocol) and `docs/game-development/ai-workflow/gamedev-rules.md` (Documentation Rules).
